Online gambling platforms are highly accessible, appealing, and addictive—especially for college students, who are three times more likely to develop gambling addictions than other U.S. adults. Many young gamblers lack tools to visualize and understand their betting habits, making it harder to recognize harmful patterns. Meanwhile, gambling sites leverage predatory tactics like personalized ads, rewards, and endless play options, encouraging extended engagement and spending. This environment fosters addiction, making moderation or quitting challenging without external support.

BetBreaker is a browser extension that activates when users access gambling sites, offering a discreet but impactful way to track and manage their betting habits. It provides real-time insights into personalized spending limits, betting trends, and risk analysis through clear visualizations. To promote responsible gambling, BetBreaker incorporates a peer accountability system where users approve each other’s bets, fostering mutual support and financial transparency.

Rather than attempting to eliminate gambling addiction outright, BetBreaker aims to cultivate mindfulness, helping users make informed decisions and develop healthier behaviors in an environment designed to exploit impulsivity.

## Design Walkthrough

The focus tasks we decided to move forward with are mutual accountability with friends and tracking financial responsibility. The task of mutual accountability with friends includes various methods for holding friends accountable. We aim to implement systems where gambling friends can hold each other accountable, and in doing so, hold themselves accountable as well. This feature encourages users to be transparent with their habits to promote healthy gambling behaviors.

Tracking financial responsibility is another critical task we want users to be able to accomplish. Unlike gambling websites, BetBreaker aims to be fully transparent and informative about users' spending and statistics.

### Track Financial Responsibility

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
        src: finance1,
        alt: "BetBreaker website stats",
        caption: "BetBreaker also allows users to look at individual betting stats, as well as their own history."
        },
        {
        src: finance2,
        alt: "specific user stats and individual bet stats",
        caption: "Some caption :domwork here:"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

BetBreaker aims to demystify how users' money is being spent and educate them along the way. Within the budget and statistics tracking features, users will be informed about what is classified as a “good” or “bad” bet based on the monetary risk associated with it, while taking their limits and habits into account. The virtual credit card will be central to the budget tracking aspect, providing users with a more concrete representation of their limits. With easily accessible information and helpful breakdowns presented in both visual and tabular formats, BetBreaker keeps users informed throughout their gambling process, promoting honesty and accountability.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
        src: finance3,
        alt: "bebreaker website stats",

        },
        {
        src: finance4,
        alt: "specific user stats and individual bet stats",
        caption: "Some caption :domwork here:"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We also allow users to view their account history within BetBreaker if they choose. For example, if a user is attempting to create a budget, they can review weekly or monthly breakdowns of their spending within BetBreaker, including specific bets that may be significant spending sinks. Users can then use this information to make more informed decisions.

        },

    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

We chose to focus on enabling users to hold themselves accountable with their peers regarding their gambling habits. This task is intended to promote mindfulness, helping users curb gambling temptations before they escalate into a larger issue.

        },
        {
        src: friends4,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        caption: "Users can view more information on other users bets to better inform their decision"
        },

    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>


Rather than focusing solely on the behemoth of gambling addiction, fostering social accountability for gambling tendencies may prove more effective than constant educational reinforcement before placing bets. Coupled with betting limits, users may find gambling impulsively less appealing if they know their peers will check in on their spending habits and loss data (and vice versa).

## Design Research and Key Insights

The impact we aimed to achieve with our research was to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological drivers and decision-making processes of habitual online gamblers. Specifically, we sought to explore why individuals choose to bet larger sums after "bad bets" and act impulsively when certain bets feel like “locks.” Additionally, we aimed to uncover insights into whether habitual gamblers have a subconscious mental financial limit while gambling—or lack thereof. To achieve this, we conducted our research primarily through interviews with college students who regularly engage in online gambling. These interviews were conversational, allowing participants to freely express their thoughts while following a flexible script. This approach ensured consistency across interviews while encouraging participants to elaborate on their personal experiences and motivations.

Our interview participants included the following individuals:

Bob: A 20-year-old college student who regularly engages in online sports betting. He frequently places bets on his college football team and professional sports leagues such as MLB, NBA, and NFL. Bob primarily uses Bovada as his betting platform but also utilizes friends who act as bookies, providing alternative betting options.

Evan: A 23-year-old college student who engages in online sports betting bi-weekly. He uses multiple betting sites and places parlays on various sporting events.

Ben: A 19-year-old college student who regularly places NFL bets on DraftKings and FanDuel. In addition to NFL bets, he places NBA parlays during the regular season.

These individuals were selected for our interviews because college students make up a significant portion of online gambling platform user bases. Since our interviewees regularly participate in online betting, we believe their insights were critical to achieving our goal of understanding the psychological factors behind gambling. This knowledge will help us design BetBreaker to better cater to the needs of college students.

### Counterproductivity in Mental Tracking:



When discussing financial habits, our interviewees expressed reluctance about the idea of physically tracking their data in spreadsheets or other mediums. When asked why they refrain from tracking their finances, one interviewee mentioned that they prefer to keep a mental note of their win/loss data, citing the lack of an easy way to report finances across multiple betting platforms as a significant barrier. Although they fully acknowledged the importance of tracking this information, the interviewees shared that relying on mental tracking has previously led to unnecessary debt.

### A Lack of Financial Responsibility:

        src: draftkings,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={"Gambling websites often make it intentionally difficult to find spending amounts or habits"}

    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In the interviews conducted with all three college students, a clear trend emerged: a significant lack of financial literacy, particularly in managing money responsibly while gambling. For example, one interviewee mentioned struggling to control his gambling when offered “bonus free bets” on NFL Sundays, as this incentivizes him to gamble more in hopes of winning a larger prize pool. Additionally, some interviewees admitted to struggling with managing their finances during losing streaks. Two interviewees shared experiences of spending hours trying to recover their losses, only to end up losing more money than they could afford.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Societal Factors Impact Gambling Habits:

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: socialgambling,
        alt: "people gambling",
    }}
    caption={"Gamblers are often influenced by social factors."}

    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Interviewees also stated that their gambling behaviors are heavily and consistently influenced by peer pressure, as their friends also participate in sports betting. Being part of a gambling community appeared to encourage some interviewees to frequently discuss their gambling strategies in an effort to better understand sports trends. It was critical for us as researchers to recognize that online gamblers are often persuaded by their peers to place certain bets, depending on whether the odds seem favorable. By aligning our design with this insight, we gained a deeper understanding of how to address the smaller-scale "bet or no bet" decision-making process.

</ProjectImageBlock>
## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process was multifaceted and involved significant revisions and changes as we progressed. We began with design research interviews with participants from our target demographic. The purpose of these interviews was to identify the type of overall design users would find comfortable and to determine which functionalities should or should not be included in the system.

Next, we created multiple designs to align with the participants’ desired functionalities. After brainstorming and deliberate selection, we decided on the web extension design. Usability tests were then conducted on this design, during which participants were informed about the tasks we wanted them to complete and the context in which they would use our application. These tests prompted revisions after each round, culminating in a refined final paper prototype.

Throughout the usability testing process, we also incorporated heuristic evaluations from our peers to identify specific defects in our product. These evaluations helped us address and revise issues both before and after the usability tests, ensuring a more polished final design.

### Back Buttons and Emergency Exits to "Go Back"

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: usabilitytesting,
        alt: "issue raised about clutter from usability testing",
    }}
    caption={
        "Issue about clutter raised during usability test, subsequent revision also shown"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

From our heuristic evaluators, we learned that our paper prototype lacked user freedom. For example, it had almost no back buttons, and each tab was hidden within a specific sequence of tasks that users had to complete in the exact order to reach their destination. This issue arose partly due to the clutter of the original web extension and partly because the tasks were designed in isolation.

To address this, we merged all our work to create a cohesive design that allowed cross-functionality between tasks. Additionally, we added emergency exits and back buttons throughout the interface, ensuring users could navigate more freely and recover from errors easily.

### Friends Leaderboard Converted to a List

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: heuristiceval,
            alt: "issue with leaderboard in heuristic evaluations",
            caption: "Heuristic issue with leaderboard"
        },
        {
            src: heuristiceval2,
            alt: "issue with back buttons in heuristic evaluations",
            caption: "Heuristic issue with back buttons"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

One insight we gained from usability testing was that displaying a leaderboard under certain metrics could convey the wrong message. Initially, we configured the leaderboard to show rankings based on metrics such as win/loss ratio, net winnings, or minimal losses. The intent was to encourage engagement with BetBreaker by leveraging users' competitive nature. However, we discovered that this approach might inadvertently motivate users to bet more in an attempt to climb the leaderboard. Additionally, users at the bottom of the leaderboard could feel unnecessarily shamed, even if they hadn’t done anything wrong.

To address this, we replaced the leaderboard with a "Friends" tab. This non-competitive feature allows users to view their friends’ statuses and most recent bets in a supportive, neutral format, avoiding the pitfalls of competition and promoting a more positive user experience.

### Turning the Web-Extension into a Full Website

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: originpaper,
            alt: "Paper prototype of folding web extension",
            caption: "Original Paper Prototype"
        },
        {
            src: finalpaper,
            alt: "Paper prototype with full website, web extension, and notifications",
            caption: "Final Paper Prototype"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

During our iterative design process we made heavy use of paper sketching and prototyping. We conducted our usability tests on our paper prototypes, and before making any form of a digital mockup, we would make 
paper prototypes of the pages or functionalities, and conduct either usability or inspection based tests on these pages, 
and revise and repeat until we felt comfortable with the design on paper. From this paper prototyping we learned that
keeping all of our information within the context of a web extesnion cluttered all the text, and that we needed to expand 
to a full website alongside the web extension, just because all the writing on the paper was simply so small. To revise this, we decided to 
migrate the information that was cluttered into a website where there is much more screen/paper space to utilize to display information to the user.
</ProjectImagesBlock>
