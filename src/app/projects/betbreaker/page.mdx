Our design problem centers on the potent combination of accessibility, appeal, and addiction potential within online gambling platforms, especially for college students. Statistics show that this demographic is three times more likely to develop gambling addictions compared to other U.S. adults, highlighting a critical vulnerability. Despite the prevalence of gambling among young adults, many gamblers lack easy access to tools that help them visualize and understand their personal gambling behaviors and trends over time. Without this self-awareness, it’s difficult for individuals to identify and curb potentially harmful patterns.
Additionally, gambling sites often employ sophisticated, predatory tactics—such as tailored advertisements, reward structures, and endless play options—that actively encourage extended engagement and spending, exacerbating the risk of addiction. These tactics foster an environment where people are subtly drawn into gambling as a habit, making it increasingly difficult to moderate or quit without external support. Addressing this issue requires a design that empowers gamblers with accessible, meaningful insights into their own behaviors, helping them make informed decisions and avoid the pitfalls of addiction in an environment designed to captivate.


BetBreaker is a popup screen web extension that appears on internet browsers when a user opens gambling sites on their laptop or pc. This pop-up screen will not always be visible, but will track and display the user’s decision making habits, such as actions that impact their own personalized spending limits, daily/weekly/monthly/yearly betting figures, and the user’s risk and odds per bet placed. In addition to helping users responsibly track their finances through easily digestible visualizations of their betting statistics, BetBreaker’s design intends to promote mutual accountability with peers while gambling. By integrating a supportive community-based system to deter financial irresponsibility and impulsivity, namely through approving one another’s bets before being placed, we intend to reinforce users with awareness and transparency of their financial and behavioral habits such that they are aided in knowing when to walk away from the vice of gambling. BetBreaker essentially aims to step away from the issue of curbing gambling addiction outright, and rather instill mindfulness behavior in its users.

## Design Walkthrough

The focus tasks that we decided to move forward with are mutual accountability with friends and track financial responsibility. The task of mutual accountability with friends encompasses multiple different methods of holding your friends accountable. We wanted to put in place systems where gambling friends can hold eachother accountable, and in doing so, keep themselves accountable. We want to allow users to be transparent with their habits to hold themselves and their friends accountable to promote healthy gambling habits.
Being able to track financial responsibility was also another important task we wanted users to be able to complete. Unlike gambling websites, we want betbreaker to be fully transparent and informative about users spending and statistics.

### Track Financial Responsibility

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: financial1,
        alt: "bebreaker website stats",
    }}
    caption={
        "Betbreaker allows users to see their stats and limits at a glance within the extension, and more info within the website"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Betbreaker intends to demystify to the user how their money is being spent, and educate them along the way. Within budget and statistics tracking, the user will be informed of what is classified as a “good” or “bad” bet statistically by the monetary risk associated with it, with due consideration to their limits and habits. The virtual credit card will be central to the budget tracking aspect, and will give users a more concrete representation of limits. With this easy to access information and helpful breakdowns of both visual and tabular formats, Betbreaker informs users throughout their gambling process to keep them honest.

</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: financial2,
        alt: "specific user stats and individual bet stats",
    }}
    caption={
        "Betbreaker also allows users to look at individual betting stats, as well as their own history."
        }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We also allow users to view their own account history within Betbreaker if they choose. For example, if a user is attempting to create a budget, they can look at weekly or monthly breakdowns of their spending within betbreaker and even specific bets that may be a spending sink, and use this information to better inform their decisions.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Mutual Accountability with Friends

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: mutual1,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Users can request approval on certain bets anonymously or directly. Also, users may vote on other users bets anonymously or directly."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We chose to focus on allowing users to hold accountability with their peers regarding their gambling habits. We intend to focus on this task to boost mindfulness in a way that may help users their curb gambling temptations before they transpire into a larger issue at hand.

</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: mutual2,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",

    caption={
        "Users can view more information on other users bets to better inform their decision"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Rather than focusing on the behemoth of gambling addiction, it appears that holding one another socially accountable of gambling tendencies may prove to be more effective than constant educational reinforcement before placing bets. Coupled with betting limits, users may find it less appealing to gamble impulsively if they know their peers will check in on their spending habits and loss data (and vice-versa).

## Design Research and Key Insights

The impact we intended to have with our research was to largely understand the psychological drivers and decision making processes of habitual online gamblers, such as why individuals choose to bet larger sums after "bad bets" and act on impulse when certain bets feel like “locks”. We also aimed to gain a deeper insight of how habitual gamblers have a subconscious mental financial limit while gambling (or lack thereof). As such, we conducted our research primarily by interviewing college students who regularly engage in online gambling. These interviews were conversational, allowing participants to express their thoughts freely while following a flexible script. This helped maintain consistency across interviews while also encouraging participants to elaborate on their personal experiences and motivations.
 
Our interview participants included the following individuals:
 
Bob: a 20-year-old college student who regularly engages in online sports betting. He frequently place bets on his own college football team but also bets on professional sports leagues like MLB, NBA, and NFL. This student primarily uses Bovada as his betting platform, though he also has friends who are bookies, providing them with alternative betting avenues.
 
Even: a 23-year-old college student who engages with online sports betting bi-weekly. He utilizes multiple betting sites and places parlays on different sporting events.
 
Ben: a 19-year-old college student who regularly places NFL bets on Draftkings and Fanduel. In addition to placing NFL bets, he places NBA parlays during the regular season.
 
These individuals were chosen to participate in our interviews, considering that college students make up a large majority of online gambling platform user bases. Given that our interviewees regularly participate in online betting, we believe that they were critical in helping us achieve our larger goal of understanding gambling psychological factors, and how we could further design BetBreaker to cater to the needs of college students themselves.

### Counterproductivity in mental tracking:


When discussing financial habits, our interviewees showed a sense of reluctancy about the thought of physically tracking their data in spreadsheets or other mediums. When questioned about why they refrain from tracking their finances, one specific interviewee mentioned that they prefer to keep a mental note of their win/loss data, as a lack of ease in reporting their finances across multiple betting platforms presents an issue. Although in full agreement about the necessity of tracking this important information, our interviewees have shared that mentally tracking their finances on a whim has previously resulted in them incurring unneeded debt.

### A Lack of Financial Responsibility:

    images={[
        {
            src: draftkings,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "Gambling websites often make it intentionally difficult to find spending amounts or habits",
        },
        {
            src: socialgambling,
            alt: "people gambling",
            caption: "Gamblers are often influenced by social factors.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In the conducted interviews with all three college students, there appeared to be a very apparent trend in a clear-cut dissociation with financial literacy, specifically in managing money responsibly when participating in the vice. For example, an interviewee mentioned that he lacks control when he is given “bonus free bets” on NFL Sunday, given that encourages him to gamble more as he would have a higher stake in winning a larger money pool. Some interviewees also seemed to struggle with managing money when trying to win back losses during downward trends, with two interviewees stating that they have experiences spending hours at a time attempting to climb out of a financial hole, only to lose more money than they can afford.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Societal Factors Impact Gambling Habits:

Interviewees also stated their gambling behaviors are heavily and constantly influenced by peer pressure, due to their friends also engaging in sports betting. Being part of a gambling community seemed to encourage some interviewees to frequently discuss their gambling strategies, in an attempt to gain a better understanding of sports trends. It was quite critical for us as researchers to also understand that online gamblers are often convinced by their peers to place certain bets, depending on whether or not the odds appear to be in their favor. In helping further align our design with this sentiment, we gained a better understanding of how to attack the smaller scale "bet or no bet" decision making process.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process was multifaceted, and involved much revision and changes 
as we went through the process. First we started with design research interviews with 
participants within our target demographic. The purpose of these was to try and find out what kind of overall design users would be
comfortable with, and which functionalities we should or shouldn't implement into the system. We then created multiple designs, to fit 
the participants' desired functionalities. After brainstorming and intentional selection we decided on the web extension design. 
We then conducted usability tests on this design informing the participants about the tasks we desire them to complete, and informing them
of the context in which they are using our application. In doing these tests, we revised our design after each subsequent test, eventually
coming to a revised final paper prototype. Along the process of conducting usability tests, we also used heuristic evaluations from our peers
to find any specific defects within our product, revising these issues before and after we conducted the usability tests.

### Usability Testing

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: usabilitytesting,
        alt: "issue raised about clutter from usability testing",
    }}
    caption={
        "Issue about clutter raised during usability test, subsequent revision also shown"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We learned from our Heuristic Evaluators that we needed to expand on some of the ideas that we had in the paper prototype, meaning that some of the information was too condensed in the paper prototype, and needed to be expanded into a full website. 
We also learned that there was not much user freedom within our paper prototype, for example, we had almost no back buttons, and each tab was hidden within a specific series of subsequent tasks that the user had to complete in the perfect order otherwise they wouldn’t get to the destination.
We also learned that much of the language that we used was not necessarily friendly to users who aren’t familiar with gambling terminology, and considering how our target audience is novice gamblers, we need to have more user friendly terminology, and/or explanations for what the terminology means.

### Friends Leaderboard Converted to a List

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: heuristiceval,
            alt: "issue with leaderboard in heuristic evaluations",
            caption: "Heuristic issue with leaderboard"
        },
        {
            src: heuristiceval2,
            alt: "issue with back buttons in heuristic evaluations",
            caption: "Heuristic issue with back buttons"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

One of the things that we learned from usability testing was that showing our users a leaderboard under certain metrics may convey the wrong idea.
We had the leaderboard configured so that users could view it by win/loss ratio, net winnings, or minimum losses. By doing this we had hoped to 
encourage engagement with Betbreaker by utilizing humans competitive nature, but we found that it might encourage users to bet more and more to 
attempt to get closer to the top of the leaderboard, and that if you were at the bottom of the leaderboard seeing this might unnecessarily 
shameful the user even if they haven't done anything wrong. To combat this, instead of displaying an leaderboard, we changed it to a "friends" tab
where users can look at their friends in a non-competitive format, with statuses, and most recent bets displayed.

### Turning the Web-Extension into a Full Website

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: originpaper,
            alt: "Paper prototype of folding web extension",
            caption: "Original Paper Prototype"
        },
        {
            src: finalpaper,
            alt: "Paper prototype with full website, web extension, and notifications",
            caption: "Final Paper Prototype"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

During our iterative design process we made heavy use of paper sketching and prototyping. We conducted our usability tests on our paper prototypes, and before making any form of a digital mockup, we would make 
paper prototypes of the pages or functionalities, and conduct either usability or inspection based tests on these pages, 
and revise and repeat until we felt comfortable with the design on paper. From this paper prototyping we learned that
keeping all of our information within the context of a web extesnion cluttered all the text, and that we needed to expand 
to a full website alongside the web extension, just because all the writing on the paper was simply so small. To revise this, we decided to 
migrate the information that was cluttered into a website where there is much more screen/paper space to utilize to display information to the user.
